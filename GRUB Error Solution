There maning problems arising due to Removing one OS from our system and then we meet at GRUB menu while turning on our system.

Solution:
.
.
Turn on your system with Boot Menu 
Go to BIOS Setup 
   Select the orginal OS of the system an press F5/F6 to make changes and F10 to save and exit
This will open your system OS
I am taking the case of Windows:
.
.
Goto Command Prompt (run this as administrator)
Type the following commands:
> diskpart (to get the diskpart promt where we will be working)
diskpart>list disk (will give all the available disk)
>select disk 0 (To select the system disk Hint: Online is the name commonly used for system disk)
>list partition (This will list all the partition)
>select partition 1 ( which is my system partion which is in mb)
>assign letter x (This will create a local disk x)
>exit (To exit from diskpart)
>x: (to get to the directory)
>dir ( to see the content)
>cd efi (to change folder)
>dir  (to get name of the folder we need to remove)
.
.
In my case I wanted to remove Ubuntu 
>rd ubuntu /s ( to remove the folder)
>confirm Y ( Final step to confirm our deletion)
.
.
Restart our system and its all good to use.
